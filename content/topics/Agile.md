#### Guideline

- **Do not**:
    - over commit.
    - take review tasks if you don't have the bandwidth.
- **Do**:
    - find the **right person to ask** (solution, issue, etc...).
    - **impact analysis** for any new change in task direction.
    - **states the objective clearly** in Jira ticket.
    - split up a **8+ SP task** to manageable smaller tasks in a sprint.
    - use 3-point guideline in the comment section to capture **blocker**: Observation (what is the problem?), Finding (what is the root cause?), and Proposed Solution (how to fix it?) 
    - **understand the question and asker's intention** before answering in daily standup.
